APP Evaluation Criteria

1) TO DO App
    1. Mobile:  Both pc and mobile but preference on mobile
          - Has the potential to be a highly unique mobile experience.
          - For example: Users could use their device camera to scan barcodes of grocery items to quickly add them to their shopping list.
          - The app could also use location services to suggest nearby grocery stores and send reminders to users when they are close to a store where they need to
             purchase items. 
    2. Story: 
         - Grocery tracker that lets you know when your food will expired and how much money your losing
         - This helps people comprehend the amount of money lost and decided on better grocery shopping habits
         - We think our friend will enjoy this product if they make it a habit to input food and check expiration dates
    4. Market:
          - The market for this app could be quite large, as it could be useful to a variety of different groups of people, such as home owners, college students,
             apartment dwellers, etc.
          - The potential user base for a grocery tracker app is quite large and diverse, as anyone who buys and consumes groceries can benefit from it.
          - It can also be useful for people with dietary restrictions or preferences, as they can easily keep track of items that fit their needs.
          - The app provides significant value to people who lead busy lives or have difficulty keeping track of what they need to buy or what they have in their
            pantry. It can also be valuable to those who want to save MONEY by avoiding waste or by taking advantage of sales.
    4. Habit:  
          - It can be if UI is seamless and easy to use otherwise people wont use it
          - If the app is designed to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly, it could become habit-forming for users who rely on it for their grocery tracking
            needs. If the app offers useful features like reminders and easy ways to add items to the list, users may find themselves opening and using it frequently
            because it covers a need.
          - For some users, they may only need to use the app once a week or so, while others may use it daily or multiple times a day. It's important to design the
            app in a way that makes it easy to use and incorporate into a user's routine.
          - The app allows users to create and maintain a grocery list, so it is both a consumption and creation tool. Users consume the app by using it to view their
            grocery list, but they also create something by adding items to the list and organizing their groceries.
    5. Scope: 
         - The technical challenge of completing the app by the deadline would depend on the skills and experience of the development team. However, integrating with
            the Kroger API and implementing database storage could pose some challenges.
           - Need database to save list
           - Or just to save to array /saved locally
           - Search for food
         - A stripped-down version of this app could still be interesting to build, with the focus on the essential features such as search and list creation. This
           could also make the app more accessible to a wider user base.
         - Its clearly define with both required and stretch features specified and has the potential to provide value to users.
    
2) Travel search - airbnb/flight
    1. Mobile: Both Pc and Mobile and they are equally preferred due to varying choices
          - A mobile app can offer features such as push notifications for flight changes or delays, in-app messaging with customer support, and quick access to
            travel information while on the go.
          - Device features such as GPS to suggest local destinations or provide travel recommendations based on user location. 
    2. Story: 
         - Good for Spring break for college students with limited resources or people trying to find flights
         - The values is not different from other travel search engines
    4. Market: Very large
          - It includes anyone who is interested in traveling, whether for business or leisure purposes. 
          - This could include single adults, couples, families, teenagers, college students, and more.
          - Is quite large and competitive, with many established players in the industry such as Expedia, Booking.com, and Kayak. However, there is always room for
            new and innovative apps that offer unique features or a better user experience.
          - The value of the app will depend on its specific features and target audience because if the app offers exclusive deals or discounts for budget-conscious
            travelers, it may appeal more to college students and budget-conscious individuals. On the other hand, if the app focuses on luxury travel options, it may
            appeal more to high-end travelers or business professionals.
          - Could include frequent travelers, budget-conscious travelers, business professionals, or travelers with specific interests such as adventure travel or
            luxury travel. 
    4. Habit: Likely not addictive seeinf as travel requires quite some capital.
          - For some users, it may be a highly necessary and frequently used app, while for others it may be used infrequently.
          - The frequency of use would also depend on the user's travel schedule and habits. For example, a frequent traveler who travels multiple times a month may
            use the app more often than someone who only travels once or twice a year.
          - In terms of user interaction, users would primarily be consuming the app to search for flights, book travel, and manage their travel itineraries. Some
            users may also use the app to discover new destinations and plan their travel based on recommendations.
    5. Scope: Seems more challenging than first idea
          - Listing of airbnb houses that require update regularly
          - Airline and flight pricing that should be accurate
          - API of all the possible housing and flights the user wants
          - Building an app that accurately updates and displays Airbnb listings and airline/flight pricing can be technically challenging, especially if the data                 needs to be updated in real-time.
          - Consider the resources and technical expertise required to build and maintain the app within the given deadline.
          - A stripped-down version of the app that focuses on just one aspect (e.g. Airbnb listings only).
          - Fairly well-defined with the goal of providing accurate and up-to-date listings for both housing and flights in one place. However, seems challenging
            with the limited timeline.
    
3) Entertainment App - Movie or Beer Search
    1. Mobile: Preferably mobile because the user is most likely to look it on the go
         - For the movie search: 
         - The app should leverage the unique capabilities of mobile devices to provide a more engaging, personalized, and seamless user experience compared
           to a website.
         - Is more convenient for the user.
         - For the beer search: 
          - Use the phone's camera to scan a beer label and provide information on that specific beer. 
          - Use location services to suggest nearby breweries or bars that serve certain types of beers. 
          - Push notifications can alert users to new beers or breweries that match their interests, while touch screen gestures can make it easy to navigate
            through the app's features and functions.
    2. Story: 
          - Young couple with a spontaneous night out, They can decided on what to watch or buy
          - Add social component to normal movie or beer search
    4. Market: 
          - For the movie search: 
           - Movie search is open to all (preferably ages 6 and up)
           - The potential user base for a movie search app can be quite substantial, as movies are a popular form of entertainment enjoyed by people of all
             ages and backgrounds. 
           - The market for a movie search app can be considered large and competitive. There are already many popular movie-related apps and websites, such as
             IMDb.
           - A well-designed app can provide a more personalized and streamlined experience compared to traditional movie-related websites and this could be
             beneficial to movie enthusiasts and provide significant value. 
           - The audience for a movie search app can be quite broad, ranging from casual moviegoers who are looking for recommendations to dedicated movie
             enthusiasts who want to stay up-to-date on the latest releases and industry news. However, it would be important to know the specific popular
             preferences of the target audience. 
          - For the beer search: 
           - Beer and alcohol search is limited for user U21
           - Given that beer is a popular beverage globally and that there are many beer enthusiasts, there is potential for a sizable user base.
           - The app could include beer enthusiasts, people looking for new beers to try, bartenders, and anyone interested in the beer industry. 
           - The app could provide significant value to a niche group of people, particularly those who are passionate about beer and interested in discovering
             new and unique beers. Additionally, it could be useful for bartenders who wants to create interesting and unique beer menus for their customers.
    4. Habit:
          - For the movie search:
           - Can get very addictive for those who live in an area with alot of restaurants to explore e.g chicago. Or during periods of numerous of movie 
             releases.         
           - On average, users may open and use the app once a week or more, especially if they are actively seeking movie information or looking for something                      to watch.
            - Users could use the app to discover new movies and watch trailers, or they could create their own watchlists and track the movies they want to see
              in the future. However, if the app is primarily focused on providing information and trailers about trending movies, it is more likely that users
              would primarily use it for consumption.
          - For the beer search:
           - The frequency of use would likely vary based on the user's interest and consumption of beer. Some users may use the app daily to discover new
             beers or to find beers that match their preferences. Others may use it less frequently, such as once a week or even less often.
           - The app would primarily be consumed by users who are looking for information on different beers, for example, their flavor profile, ratings, and
             reviews. However, the app could have the functionality to create a personalized list of beers they want to try or to keep track of the beers they
             have tried and their ratings.
    5. Scope: Same scope as the travel search
          - For the movie search: 
           - Listing of all possible movies, cinemas and pubs. These have to be updated regularly.
           - API of these places.
           - The technical challenge of completing the app by the deadline will depend on the skills and experience of the team. However, since the
             app will require integrating with an API, displaying data in a RecyclerView, playing videos, and handling user interactions, it may be considered
             moderately challenging.
           - A stripped-down version of the app could still be interesting to build, as it could be focus on the core functionality of the app and then refine the
             user experience. For example, the app could initially display only a limited number of movies or trailers, or could omit certain features such as search                or filtering.
           - As for the clear definition of the product, it specifies the key features and API to be used. However, some additional details may need to be considered,
             such as the user interface design, error handling, and testing requirements.
          - For the Beer Search:
           - The app has a clear purpose - to help users search for beers and discover new ones based on their preferences.
           - The technical challenge resides in the fact that integrating multiple APIs and designing an intuitive user interface can be time-consuming.
           - A stripped-down version of the app could still be interesting to build if it focuses on a few core features, such as basic beer search and filtering
             options. This approach could allow for a more manageable development timeline.
