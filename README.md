## Summary

This document provides an overview, project spec, and wireframes for our team's capstone project: The Stay Stocked app is a user-friendly mobile application designed to help individuals keep track of their groceries. It sends reminders when items are about to expire, and notifies users of the estimated amount of money lost when food items expire. By facilitating better management of food waste and encouraging budget consciousness, this app is a valuable tool for users.
